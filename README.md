# Godot Minimal Project Template [![Made for Godot 4.0+][badge]][godot]

An absolutely minimal Godot project template for 2D games.

>   **â„¹ Note**: This is an _work in progress_, upgraded version for Godot 4.0
    (beta). The Godot 3 version of this template is available under the
    `godot-3` development branch.


## Project Settings

-   Viewport dimensions at 854x480 (â‰ˆ16:9 aspect ratio)
-   Window stretch mode set as `canvas_items` and aspect set to `keep`
-   Sane defaults for 2D rendering:
    -   Textures imported using the `2D` preset by default
    -   Default texture filter set to `Nearest` on Project Settings
    -   2D pixel snapping options enabled on Project Settings
-   No application icon â”€ bring yours if you need one!
-   Includes a main scene with an empty script.


## Quick setup guide

1.  [Download][download] this repository, unzip the file containing the
    template project folder and rename it to your liking.

2.  Use Godot's Project Manager to import the template project.

3.  Select the newly imported project, typing "minimal" in the filter field if
    needed, and rename it to change the game title.

4.  Open the game project to start editing it.

>   **ðŸ’¡ Hint**: Keep your game projects organized and let Godot's Project
    Manager discover them for you, automatically. With the Godot Engine editor
    open, find the "Editor Settings" under the "Editor" menu, scroll through
    "Filesystem > Directories" on the left-side panel and pick a folder of your
    choice under "Autoscan Project Path".


## Motivation

As I am frequently starting projects using those same settings, be it short
lived games or just my usual throw away ideas, I made this little template to
help me get to the interesting stuff faster.
