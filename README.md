# Godot Minimal Project Template [![Made for Godot 3.3+][badge]][godot]

An absolutely minimal Godot project template for 2D games.


## Project Settings

-   Screen resolution at 854x480 (â‰ˆ16:9 aspect ratio)
-   Graphics mode: `GLES2`
-   Window stretch mode set as `2D` and aspect as `Keep`
-   Texture import set as '2D Pixel' by default
-   Node naming style set as `snake_case`
-   No application icon (Bring yours if you need one!)
-   Includes a main scene with an empty script


## Motivation

As I am frequently starting projects using those same settings, be it short
lived games or just the usual throw away ideas, I made this little template
to get to the interesting stuff faster.
