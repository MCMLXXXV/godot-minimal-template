# Godot Minimal Project Template [![Made for Godot 3.3+][badge]][godot]

An absolutely minimal Godot project template for 2D games.


## Project Settings

-   Screen resolution at 854x480 (â‰ˆ16:9 aspect ratio)
-   Graphics mode: `GLES2`
-   Window stretch mode set as `2D` and aspect as `Keep`
-   Textures are imported using the '2D Pixel' preset by default
-   Node naming style set as `snake_case`
-   No application icon â”€ bring yours if you need one!
-   Includes a main scene with an empty script.


## Quick start guide

1.  [Download][download] this repository and unzip the file containing the
    template project folder; rename that folder.

2.  Use Godot's Project Manager to import the template project.

3.  Select the newly imported project, typing "minimal" in the filter field if
    needed, and rename it to change the game title.

4.  Open the game project to start editing it.

>   **ðŸ’¡ Hint**: Keep your game projects tidy and let Godot's Project Manager
    discover them for you, automatically. With the Godot Engine editor open,
    find the "Editor Settings" under the "Editor" menu, scroll through
    "Filesystem > Directories" on the left-side panel and pick a folder of your
    choice under "Autoscan Project Path".


## Motivation

As I am frequently starting projects using those same settings, be it short
lived games or just the usual throw away ideas, I made this little template
to get to the interesting stuff faster.
